# Repository Overview

This repository contains three interconnected projects, each addressing different aspects of polygonization, optimization and evaluation.

## Project 1 - Polygonization of Point Sets

Project 1 focuses on creating simple polygons from 2D point sets using Incremental and Convex Hull algorithms.

## Project 2 - Polygon Optimization

Project 2 involves optimizing simple polygons created by the algorithms of Project 1, utilizing local search and simulated annealing algorithms.

## Project 3 - Polygon Evaluation

Project 3 evaluates the various algorithms for polygon creation and optimization of the previous Projects, assessing maximizing and minimizing polygon area.
